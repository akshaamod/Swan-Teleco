# Swan-Teleco
Carry out **Churn Analysis** on Swan Teleco Data. This was done using Machine Learning Models (Logistic Regression and Decision Trees). This also involved Data Cleaning, Data Anaysis and Exploration. Created a self-serving Presentation Deck of our findings, and excel files  of customers and their probability to churn.
