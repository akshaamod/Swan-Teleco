# Swan-Teleco
## Overview
This projects aim was to carry out **Churn Analysis** on Swan Teleco Data in order to identify what the reasons are for churning and which customers are at-risk of churning. Starting off with some data cleaning, data anaysis and exploration, we then used machine learning models (Logistic Regression and Decision Trees), to carry out the churn analysis. We also created a self-serving presentation deck with our findings, and excel files  of customers and their probability to churn.
